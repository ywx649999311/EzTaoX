  "description": "`EzTaoX` is a flexible framework for multi-wavelength and multi-survey AGN light-curve modeling using Gaussian Processes (GPs).  Built on top of `tinygp`---a scalable GP library in `JAX`---`EzTaoX` is fast, modular, and integrates seamlessly with the `JAX` ecosystem for statistical inference and modern machine learning."
